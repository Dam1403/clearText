clearText-
==========
Plans:
separate java files from class files*
find a simple syntax for shell commands
   one that allows both commands and text to be read from a file
write a brute force module that can force text from one word to another
  from a selected group of modules*
-alphabet handling 
Allow the import of any module in javas encryption library
    allow commands to be renamed*
allow classes to be loaded during runtime(Danger)
polish with help exception handling and documentation****
Mobile platform development
Output To FILE!!****
Setup Module Server.?
   accounts and supporting user uploads.
clearText v.01

clearText is the main java file.
refInit Loads the classes into memory for use.
functObj is the interface that defines modules Its class file must be present in the functObjs directory
   So the function modules can Compile.

Current installation steps


1. Compile the files (javac clearText.java)
2. Compile The function Modules (Make sure your in the main clearText directory) javac functObjs/(Module).java
   (Im currently working on a way to do this on startup)
3. run the program java clearText 
4. type "help" in the program for a list of commands
